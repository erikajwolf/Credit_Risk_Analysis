# Predicting Credit Risk

## Fast Lending and Machine Learning
Fast Lending is in need of a machine learning model to predict credit risk--wanting to be able to quickly identify good candidates for loans. Jill has been tasked with training and evaluating machine learning models with unbalanced tasks as credit risk is inherently imbalanced (there are more good candidates than risky candidates).


Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Results

**- Naive Random Oversampling **

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
